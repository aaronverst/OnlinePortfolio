                <p class="card-text"><b>Skills Applied: </b>Throughout my first co-op term, I primarily developed realistic virtual reality (VR) models that were deployed to clients and used throughout the design phase of construction projects.

                <p class="card-text"><b>Concepts Learned: </b>Throughout the term, I improved my collaborative development skills. For example, I learned how to manage and update GitHub repositories in a team-based setting. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I also gained valuable experience working remotely for the first time. This allowed me to sharpen my time management skills and develop an effective personal workflow. </p>

                <p class="card-text"><b>Skills Applied: </b>In my second co-op term with Ulliman Schutte, I had the oppurtunity to assist in a company-wide ERP system implementation. This primarily consisted of custom log and query generation on the backend side of the system. This task required knowlege of database architechture and  best practices of table management. I also expanded my skills in virtual reality development and single-handedly took on projects from our project engineers.</p>
                
                <p class="card-text"><b>Concepts Learned: </b>My second co-op term exposed me to new career oppurtunities within the field of computer science. Specifically, I was able to establish a foundational knowlege of databases and how to dynamically modify/pull data from them. Also, I gained valuable experience conducting meetings and collaborating with co-workers in a virtual setting through various platforms such as Microsoft Teams. </p>

                <p class="card-text"></p> In my opinion, being a successful developer requires one to allocate proper time and effort into their craft. Through learning from past experiences and personal research, it is evident to me that cutting corners in the development phase of a project can have dire consequences in a final project. By dynamically structuring a project and writing efficient code, one can set themselves up for success.

Since my enrollment, I have completed various co-op experiences and projects that have enhanced my skills as a coder and problem solver. My co-op experiences have been influencial in sharpening my collaboration skills and my professional development has been accelerated. However, that's not to say that my co-op experiences weren't tough at times. By deploying my skills in a professional environement, I was subject to critique and criticism by team members regarding projects and tasks that I was assigned. This ultimately lead me towards becoming a better collaborator and overall developer. I was surprised at how much I was able to learn while on co-op. Co-op showed me that I enjoy learning through experience and trial rather than through books and theory. If I had to do my co-op journey over again, I would have done more research on the career paths available in computer science. Prior to my first co-op experience I was unaware of how broad the field was and how many oppurtunities exist within programming and development. In my remaining co-op terms I intend to explore this realization and expose myself to new areas of computer science which I am unfamiliar with. I hope that this will lead me in to discovering new hobbies and possibly even a career path.
